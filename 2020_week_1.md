This week I started the DataCamp track [Machine Learning Scientist With Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python). 
I found that I'm not able to retain as much of the DataCamp courses as I did with DataQuest, since the latter is a bit more intent on putting excercises in the context of real-life practice 
I understand the course videos, which are concise and informative, but the exercises that follow carry you along in such a handheld way that I glide through them without retaining the knowledge that will allow me to reproduce them, no matter how hard I try to focus. Since I learn best by doing actual projects, facing problems and solving them
