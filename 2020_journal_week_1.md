# How DataQuest Does A Better Job At Teaching Than DataCamp

This week I started the DataCamp track [Machine Learning Scientist With Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python). 

I found that I'm not able to retain as much of the DataCamp courses as I did with DataQuest, and having spent several hours on both platforms, I came to the conclusion this has to do with two things: 

- DataQuest is slightly better at teaching in a way that favors retention
- DataQuest is slightly better at explaining the context: the ins and outs of the work a data scientist does

DataCamp's exercises that follow carry you along in such a handheld way that I glide through them without retaining the knowledge that will allow me to reproduce them, no matter how hard I try to focus. Since I learn best by doing actual projects, facing problems and solving them, I decided to create simple projects to implement the concepts I'm learning as I go. This means it will take me longer to complete the course, but I think I'm going to learn more ando also have something to show for it when I finish, which motivates me a lot. 

I learnt to do this because this is how DataQuest did it: at the end of each unit they had you complete an entire project in Jupyer Notebook, which left you with ready-to-publish material. I think it's a great way to help students build a portfolio, gain confidence to carry projects from begining to end, and retain the concepts in the long term. 

They also had you complete a long exercise with minimal instructions at the end of some chapters, which is a great way to make your memory fetch the concepts (instead of having the steps right there on the screen) or go back in search for them, which makes you aware of the gaps in your knowledge. 

If you are familiar with Barbara Oakley's teachings in [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), you'll remember her warning against the ["illusion of competence"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). Just because we're able to retrieve something from short-term memory (such as being able to repeat a sentence having just read it), doesn't mean that it has been stored in long-term memory. This is how DataCamp does it, by describing the steps you need to take to fill in the blanks in a piece of code. It's great to begin with, but unless you're a quick learner you will probably forget what you just did moments after clicking "Next". 

The process of carrying out tasks with minimal instructions after the guided part also forces you to do what Barbara Oakley calls "interleaving": going back and forth between concepts and understanding which ones apply where and why. You start to internally form critheria for when to use each tool instead of mechanically following a recipe.

I still like DataCamp. Their course videos are clear and concise, the teachers are great and the courses I took helped me improve, that's why I continue to take them (that and because my company offers them to me for free). I just think DataQuest was more mindful about the process of learning when they created their courses.
